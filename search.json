    "text": "5th-year guard Brice Williams had a phenomenal senior season for the Nebraska Cornhuskers breaking the single season scoring record previously held by guard James Palmer Jr. Williams averaged 20.4 points, 4.1 rebounds, 2.9 assists, and 1.1 steals on 47.1 FG%, 37 three point%, and 88.3% from the line.\nAlthough the Huskers came up just short of making the NCAA Tournament, could Brice Williams have made an All-American team had they finished with a better record than 17-14?\nThere is an advanced metric called z-scores which is the number of standard deviations by which the value of a raw score is above or below the mean value.\nIn simpler terms, a z-score is how far a data point is from the mean value of a set of data, that is measured in standard deviations (the amount of variation of the values of a variable about its mean).\nWilliams is ~10 standard deviations higher than the mean value when looking across the entire landscape of the NCAA, that only places him ahead of 2 All-Americans, Houston’s L.J. Cryer and Texas Tech’s JT Toppin. The All-American with the highest z-score was Purdue’s Braden Smith with a staggering 18.85 z-score. This explains how he won the Bob Cousy Award (best point guard in NCAA Division 1 basketball).\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(hoopR)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\n\ncbbplayers &lt;- load_mbb_player_box(2025)\n\ntotals &lt;- cbbplayers |&gt; \n  group_by(athlete_display_name, team_short_display_name, ) |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    totalmins = sum(minutes, na.rm=TRUE),\n    totalpts = sum(points, na.rm=TRUE), \n    totaloffrebs = sum(offensive_rebounds, na.rm=TRUE),\n    totaldefrebs = sum(defensive_rebounds, na.rm=TRUE),\n    totalrebs = sum(rebounds, na.rm=TRUE),\n    totalasts = sum(assists, na.rm=TRUE),\n    totalstls = sum(steals, na.rm=TRUE), \n    totalblks = sum(blocks, na.rm=TRUE),\n    totaltos = sum(turnovers, na.rm=TRUE), \n    totalfouls = sum(fouls, na.rm=TRUE),\n    totalfgsmade = sum(field_goals_made, na.rm=TRUE),\n    totalfgsatt = sum(field_goals_attempted, na.rm=TRUE),\n    total3ptsmade = sum(three_point_field_goals_made, na.rm=TRUE),\n    total3ptsatt = sum(three_point_field_goals_attempted, na.rm=TRUE),\n    totalftsmade = sum(free_throws_made, na.rm=TRUE),\n    totalftsatt = sum(free_throws_attempted, na.rm=TRUE)\n  ) |&gt; \n  ungroup()\n\ntotal_zscores &lt;- totals |&gt;\n  filter(totalmins &gt; 50) |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    ptsZscore = as.numeric(scale(totalpts, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)),\n    rbZscore = as.numeric(scale(totalrebs, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)),\n    mpZscore = as.numeric(scale(totalmins, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)),\n    astZscore = as.numeric(scale(totalasts, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)),\n    ftsmadeZscore = as.numeric(scale(totalftsmade, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)),\n    stlZscore = as.numeric(scale(totalstls, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)),\n    Score = ptsZscore + rbZscore + mpZscore + astZscore + ftsmadeZscore + stlZscore\n  ) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(Score))\n\nallamer &lt;- c(\"Brice Williams\", \"Cooper Flagg\", \"Johni Broome\", \"Walter Clayton Jr.\", \"JT Toppin\", \"Braden Smith\", \"John Tonje\", \"Ryan Kalkbrenner\", \"Mark Sears\", \"Kam Jones\", \"PJ Haggerty\", \"Eric Dixon\", \"L.J.

He is up there among the best in scoring, as he finished 13th in the country at 20.4 PPG. The only 2 All-Americans he finished below were Villanova’s Eric Dixon (23.3) which lead the entire NCAA and Memphis’ PJ Haggerty (21.7) good for 3rd.\nWilliams being above 13 of the 2024-25 All-Americans shows why he was elite at putting the ball in the basket this season. He even had a better scoring season than the NBA’s projected #1 pick in the 2025 Draft, Duke’s Cooper Flagg.\n\n\nCode\ncumpoints &lt;- cbbplayers |&gt; \n  filter(athlete_display_name %in% allamer) |&gt; \n  arrange(game_date) |&gt; \n  group_by(athlete_display_name) |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    cumulative_points = cumsum(points)\n  ) |&gt; \n  ungroup()\n\nbw &lt;- cumpoints |&gt; \n  filter(athlete_display_name == \"Brice Williams\")\n\ncf &lt;- cumpoints |&gt; \n  filter(athlete_display_name == \"Cooper Flagg\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_step(data=cumpoints, aes(x=game_date, y=cumulative_points, group=athlete_display_name), color=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_step(data=bw, aes(x=game_date, y=cumulative_points, group=athlete_display_name), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_step(data=cf, aes(x=game_date, y=cumulative_points, group=athlete_display_name), color=\"darkblue\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=(as.Date(\"2025-3-31\")), y=535, label=\"Brice Williams\", color=\"red\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=(as.Date(\"2025-3-7\")), y=635, label=\"Cooper Flagg\", color=\"darkblue\") +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Date\", \n    y=\"Points\", \n    title=\"Brice Williams trajectory similar to the No. 1 pick\", \n    subtitle=\"The Huskers floundered on the court when Williams wasn't himself as shown by \\nthe plateau in January with the 6 game losing streak.\", \n    caption=\"Source: hoopR | By Dylan DuPont\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the most important advanced statistics is how valuable a player is to their team when they are on the court. Via EvanMiya, The BPR is the Bayesian Performance Rating which is the sum of their offensive and defensive BPR that measures a player’s overall value to his team when they are on the court.\nAnd the Box BPR is a sum of a player’s Box Offensive BPR and Box Defensive BPR, it’s an estimate of a player’s overall value based only on this player’s individual box score stats. You want a higher rating in both advanced statistics (BPR and BoxBPR).\nWhen comparing, Williams finished in the bottom left quadrant with a 4.01 BPR and a 4.65 BoxBRP. All but four AA’s finished ahead of the 5.42 BPR mean, meanwhile only two AA’s finished below the average BoxBPR (4.89). The top 2 candidates up for National Player of the Year, unsurprisingly finished top 2 in both statistics, with Flagg even having a sizeable lead on Broome.\nThis means outside of Haggerty, Williams wasn’t necessarily too close to any other AA when it came to his value of being on the court, a little surprising isn’t it? With how much the Huskers relied on Williams in a lot of games and especially down the stretch, you’d figure his value of being on the court would be much higher.\n\n\nCode\nefficiency &lt;- read_csv(\"evanmiya.csv\")\n\nallamereff &lt;- c(\"Brice Williams\", \"Cooper Flagg\", \"Johni Broome\", \"Walter Clayton\", \"JT Toppin\", \"Braden Smith\", \"John Tonje\", \"Ryan Kalkbrenner\", \"Mark Sears\", \"Kam Jones\", \"PJ Haggerty\", \"Eric Dixon\", \"LJ Cryer\", \"RJ Luis\", \"Trey Kaufman-Renn\", \"Zakai Zeigler\")\n\neffaas &lt;- efficiency |&gt; \n    filter(name %in% allamereff)\n\nbrice &lt;- efficiency |&gt; \n  filter(name == \"Brice Williams\")\n\ncooper &lt;- efficiency |&gt; \n  filter(name == \"Cooper Flagg\")\n\njohni &lt;- efficiency |&gt; \n  filter(name == \"Johni Broome\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(\n    data=efficiency, \n    aes(x=BPR, y=boxBPR, size=poss),\n    alpha = .3) +\n  scale_size(range = c(2, 7), name=\"Possessions\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data=effaas,\n    aes(x=BPR, y=boxBPR, size=poss),\n    color=\"lightblue\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data=brice,\n    aes(x=BPR, y=boxBPR, size=poss),\n    color=\"red\") + \n  geom_vline(xintercept = 5.41789, color=\"black\") + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 4.894679, color=\"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=10.35, y=8, label=\"Elite Value\"), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=0.9, y=0, label=\"Bad Value\"), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(x=2.57, y=4.64, label=\"Brice Williams\") \n    ) +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(x=10.8, y=9.15, label=\"Flagg\") \n    ) +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(x=9.18, y=9, label=\"Broome\") \n    ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks=c(0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11)) +\n   labs(\n    x=\"Overall Value to Team When on Floor (BPR) \", \n    y=\"Value - Indivdual Stats (BoxBPR)\", \n    title=\"Most All-Americans incredibly valuable when on court\", \n    subtitle=\"The &lt;span style = 'color:lightblue;'&gt;2 leading candidates&lt;/span&gt; for National Player of the Year were the most valuable players \\nin the NCAA this year, meanwhile &lt;span style = 'color:red;'&gt;Brice Williams&lt;/span&gt; was near the middle of the pack.\", \n    caption=\"Source: EvanMiya | By Dylan DuPont\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple()\n  ) +\n   theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll in all looking deeper into analytics, even had Nebraska finished with a better record, it’s very unlikely that Brice Williams’ 2024-25 campaign would have resulted in an All-American nod. Some programs are overshadowed in the world of college basketball and Nebraska is definitely one of those due to being the only Power Conference school to have never won an NCAA Tournament game."
