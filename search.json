    "section": "",
    "text": "5th-year guard Brice Williams had a phenomenal senior season for the Nebraska Cornhuskers breaking the single season scoring record previously held by guard James Palmer Jr. Williams averaged 20.4 points, 4.1 rebounds, 2.9 assists, and 1.1 steals on 47.1 FG%, 37 three point%, and 88.3% from the line.\nAlthough the Huskers came up just short of making the NCAA Tournament, could Brice Williams have made an All-American team had they finished with a better record than 17-14?\nThere is an advanced metric called z-scores which is the number of standard deviations by which the value of a raw score is above or below the mean value.\nIn simpler terms, a z-score is how far a data point is from the mean value of a set of data, that is measured in standard deviations (the amount of variation of the values of a variable about its mean).\nWilliams is ~10 standard deviations higher than the mean value when looking across the entire landscape of the NCAA, that only places him ahead of 2 All-Americans, Houston’s L.J. Cryer and Texas Tech’s JT Toppin. The All-American with the highest z-score was Purdue’s Braden Smith with a staggering 18.85 z-score. This explains how he won the Bob Cousy Award (best point guard in NCAA Division 1 basketball).\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(hoopR)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\n\ncbbplayers &lt;- load_mbb_player_box(2025)\n\ntotals &lt;- cbbplayers |&gt; \n  group_by(athlete_display_name, team_short_display_name, ) |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    totalmins = sum(minutes, na.rm=TRUE),\n    totalpts = sum(points, na.rm=TRUE), \n    totaloffrebs = sum(offensive_rebounds, na.rm=TRUE),\n    totaldefrebs = sum(defensive_rebounds, na.rm=TRUE),\n    totalrebs = sum(rebounds, na.rm=TRUE),\n    totalasts = sum(assists, na.rm=TRUE),\n    totalstls = sum(steals, na.rm=TRUE), \n    totalblks = sum(blocks, na.rm=TRUE),\n    totaltos = sum(turnovers, na.rm=TRUE), \n    totalfouls = sum(fouls, na.rm=TRUE),\n    totalfgsmade = sum(field_goals_made, na.rm=TRUE),\n    totalfgsatt = sum(field_goals_attempted, na.rm=TRUE),\n    total3ptsmade = sum(three_point_field_goals_made, na.rm=TRUE),\n    total3ptsatt = sum(three_point_field_goals_attempted, na.rm=TRUE),\n    totalftsmade = sum(free_throws_made, na.rm=TRUE),\n    totalftsatt = sum(free_throws_attempted, na.rm=TRUE)\n  ) |&gt; \n  ungroup()\n\ntotal_zscores &lt;- totals |&gt;\n  filter(totalmins &gt; 50) |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    ptsZscore = as.numeric(scale(totalpts, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)),\n    rbZscore = as.numeric(scale(totalrebs, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)),\n    mpZscore = as.numeric(scale(totalmins, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)),\n    astZscore = as.numeric(scale(totalasts, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)),\n    ftsmadeZscore = as.numeric(scale(totalftsmade, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)),\n    stlZscore = as.numeric(scale(totalstls, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)),\n    Score = ptsZscore + rbZscore + mpZscore + astZscore + ftsmadeZscore + stlZscore\n  ) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(Score))\n\nallamer &lt;- c(\"Brice Williams\", \"Cooper Flagg\", \"Johni Broome\", \"Walter Clayton Jr.\", \"JT Toppin\", \"Braden Smith\", \"John Tonje\", \"Ryan Kalkbrenner\", \"Mark Sears\", \"Kam Jones\", \"PJ Haggerty\", \"Eric Dixon\", \"L.J.

The only 2 All-Americans he finished below were Villanova’s Eric Dixon (23.3) which lead the entire NCAA and Memphis’ PJ Haggerty (21.7) good for 3rd.\nWilliams being above 13 of the 2024-25 All-Americans shows why he was elite at putting the ball in the basket this season. He even had a better scoring season than the NBA’s projected #1 pick in the 2025 Draft, Duke’s Cooper Flagg.\n\n\nCode\ncumpoints &lt;- cbbplayers |&gt; \n  filter(athlete_display_name %in% allamer) |&gt; \n  arrange(game_date) |&gt; \n  group_by(athlete_display_name) |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    cumulative_points = cumsum(points)\n  ) |&gt; \n  ungroup()\n\nbw &lt;- cumpoints |&gt; \n  filter(athlete_display_name == \"Brice Williams\")\n\ncf &lt;- cumpoints |&gt; \n  filter(athlete_display_name == \"Cooper Flagg\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_step(data=cumpoints, aes(x=game_date, y=cumulative_points, group=athlete_display_name), color=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_step(data=bw, aes(x=game_date, y=cumulative_points, group=athlete_display_name), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_step(data=cf, aes(x=game_date, y=cumulative_points, group=athlete_display_name), color=\"darkblue\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=(as.Date(\"2025-3-31\")), y=535, label=\"Brice Williams\", color=\"red\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=(as.Date(\"2025-3-7\")), y=635, label=\"Cooper Flagg\", color=\"darkblue\") +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Date\", \n    y=\"Points\", \n    title=\"Brice Williams trajectory similar to the No. 1 pick\", \n    subtitle=\"The Huskers floundered on the court when Williams wasn't himself as shown by \\nthe plateau in January with the 6 game losing streak.\", \n    caption=\"Source: hoopR | By Dylan DuPont\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the most important advanced statistics is how valuable a player is to their team when they are on the court. Via EvanMiya, The BPR is the Bayesian Performance Rating which is the sum of their offensive and defensive BPR that measures a player’s overall value to his team when they are on the court.\nAnd the Box BPR is a sum of a player’s Box Offensive BPR and Box Defensive BPR, it’s an estimate of a player’s overall value based only on this player’s individual box score stats. You want a higher rating in both advanced statistics (BPR and BoxBPR).\nWhen comparing, Williams finished in the bottom left quadrant with a 4.01 BPR and a 4.65 BoxBRP. All but four AA’s finished ahead of the 5.42 BPR mean, meanwhile only two AA’s finished below the average BoxBPR (4.89). The top 2 candidates up for National Player of the Year, unsurprisingly finished top 2 in both statistics, with Flagg even having a sizeable lead on Broome.\nThis means outside of Haggerty, Williams wasn’t necessarily too close to any other AA when it came to his value of being on the court, a little surprising isn’t it? With how much the Huskers relied on Williams in a lot of games and especially down the stretch, you’d figure his value of being on the court would be much higher.\n\n\nCode\nefficiency &lt;- read_csv(\"evanmiya.csv\")\n\nallamereff &lt;- c(\"Brice Williams\", \"Cooper Flagg\", \"Johni Broome\", \"Walter Clayton\", \"JT Toppin\", \"Braden Smith\", \"John Tonje\", \"Ryan Kalkbrenner\", \"Mark Sears\", \"Kam Jones\", \"PJ Haggerty\", \"Eric Dixon\", \"LJ Cryer\", \"RJ Luis\", \"Trey Kaufman-Renn\", \"Zakai Zeigler\")\n\neffaas &lt;- efficiency |&gt; \n    filter(name %in% allamereff)\n\nbrice &lt;- efficiency |&gt; \n  filter(name == \"Brice Williams\")\n\ncooper &lt;- efficiency |&gt; \n  filter(name == \"Cooper Flagg\")\n\njohni &lt;- efficiency |&gt; \n  filter(name == \"Johni Broome\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(\n    data=efficiency, \n    aes(x=BPR, y=boxBPR, size=poss),\n    alpha = .3) +\n  scale_size(range = c(2, 7), name=\"Possessions\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data=effaas,\n    aes(x=BPR, y=boxBPR, size=poss),\n    color=\"lightblue\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data=brice,\n    aes(x=BPR, y=boxBPR, size=poss),\n    color=\"red\") + \n  geom_vline(xintercept = 5.41789, color=\"black\") + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 4.894679, color=\"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=10.35, y=8, label=\"Elite Value\"), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=0.9, y=0, label=\"Bad Value\"), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(x=2.57, y=4.64, label=\"Brice Williams\") \n    ) +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(x=10.8, y=9.15, label=\"Flagg\") \n    ) +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(x=9.18, y=9, label=\"Broome\") \n    ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks=c(0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11)) +\n   labs(\n    x=\"Overall Value to Team When on Floor (BPR) \", \n    y=\"Value - Indivdual Stats (BoxBPR)\", \n    title=\"Most All-Americans incredibly valuable when on court\", \n    subtitle=\"The &lt;span style = 'color:lightblue;'&gt;2 leading candidates&lt;/span&gt; for National Player of the Year were the most valuable players \\nin the NCAA this year, meanwhile &lt;span style = 'color:red;'&gt;Brice Williams&lt;/span&gt; was near the middle of the pack.\", \n    caption=\"Source: EvanMiya | By Dylan DuPont\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple()\n  ) +\n   theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll in all looking deeper into analytics, even had Nebraska finished with a better record, it’s very unlikely that Brice Williams’ 2024-25 campaign would have resulted in an All-American nod. Some programs are overshadowed in the world of college basketball and Nebraska is definitely one of those due to being the only Power Conference school to have never won an NCAA Tournament game."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The 2024-25 NBA season has had a wild Most Valuable Player (MVP) race that has been up and down all year long. The top 5 MVP candidates on a lot of people’s have been Denver’s Nikola Jokic, Oklahoma City’s Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Boston’s Jayson Tatum, Milwaukee’s Giannis Antetokounmpo, and New York’s Jalen Brunson. Most people expect the race to come down to either Jokic or SGA. Who should win the 2024-25 NBA MVP?\nGilgeous-Alexander had a fantastic season as he won the NBA scoring title (most PPG in the league) with 32.7 points per game, which is 2.3 higher than the next player Antetokounmpo (30.4).\nAlthough Jokic didn’t rack up as many points as Shai, the Joker dominated the entire season in every aspect. He averaged a triple-double, which is the 7th time in NBA history someone has averaged a triple-double across an entire NBA season. Jokic is the 3rd player in NBA history to average a triple-double over a season and the first big man to ever do it. Oscar Robertson did it once and Jokic’s current teammate, Russell Westbrook, did it 4 times.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(hoopR)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\n\nnbaplayers &lt;- load_nba_player_box(2025)\n\nplayers &lt;- nbaplayers |&gt; \n  filter(season_type != \"5\" & season_type != \"3\" & team_name != \"Team Kenny\" & team_name != \"Team Shaq\" & team_name != \"Team Candace\" & team_name != \"Team Chuck\")\n\navgs &lt;- players |&gt; \n  group_by(athlete_display_name, team_display_name) |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    mpg = mean(minutes, na.rm=TRUE),\n    ppg = mean(points, na.rm=TRUE),\n    rpg = mean(rebounds, na.rm=TRUE),\n    apg = mean(assists, na.rm=TRUE),\n    stl = mean(steals, na.rm=TRUE),\n  ) |&gt; \n  ungroup()\n\nmvps &lt;- c(\"Shai Gilgeous-Alexander\", \"Nikola Jokic\", \"Jayson Tatum\", \"Giannis Antetokounmpo\", \"Jalen Brunson\")\n\nmvpavgs &lt;- avgs |&gt; \n  filter(athlete_display_name %in% mvps) |&gt; \n  rename(Team = team_display_name) |&gt; \n  rename(Player = athlete_display_name)\n\nmvpavgs |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt; \n  cols_label(\n    mpg = \"MP\",\n    ppg = \"PTS\",\n    rpg = \"REB\",\n    apg = \"AST\",\n    stl = \"STL\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"The Top 2 MVP Candidates Come From the West\",\n    subtitle = \"The race for the most prestigious individual NBA award, Most Valuable Player, is down to \\na tight one between Nikola Jokic and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.\"\n  ) |&gt; \n  fmt_number(\n    columns = c(\"mpg\", \"ppg\", \"rpg\", \"apg\", \"stl\"),\n    decimals = 1,\n    use_seps = FALSE\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**Source:** hoopR  |  **By:** Dylan DuPont\")\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n     )\n   ) |&gt;\n  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"#0e2240\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"#fec524\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Player == \"Nikola Jokic\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Top 2 MVP Candidates Come From the West\n\n\nThe race for the most prestigious individual NBA award, Most Valuable Player, is down to a tight one between Nikola Jokic and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.\n\n\nPlayer\nTeam\nMP\nPTS\nREB\nAST\nSTL\n\n\n\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo\nMilwaukee Bucks\n34.2\n30.3\n12.0\n6.5\n0.9\n\n\nJalen Brunson\nNew York Knicks\n35.4\n26.0\n2.9\n7.3\n0.9\n\n\nJayson Tatum\nBoston Celtics\n36.4\n26.8\n8.7\n6.0\n1.1\n\n\nNikola Jokic\nDenver Nuggets\n36.8\n29.6\n12.7\n10.2\n1.8\n\n\nShai Gilgeous-Alexander\nOklahoma City Thunder\n34.2\n32.5\n5.0\n6.3\n1.7\n\n\n\nSource: hoopR | By: Dylan DuPont\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the most important things on the court is obviously helping your team gain points vs turning the ball the over and getting no points. The good thing about the top 5 candidates is that they are all good at sharing the ball. All 5 players averaged 6.0 assists per game or more.\nJokic absolutely dominated the NBA in passing as he posted 716 assists and only 230 turnovers, something of a center that was unheard of until Nikola Jokic graced the NBA. His 716 assists broke his own record (708) for most assists in a season by a center. Next season, the Joker will already break Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s record for most all-time regular season assists (5,660).

It’s an estimate of how many wins an individual player is responsible for based on their offensive and defensive production.\nSGA led the entire NBA with a staggering 16.7 win shares which finishes 60th all-time, Jokic is not far behind with a 16.4, which puts his season at 66th all-time. There is two other players ahead of Antetokounmpo in Win Shares, six others ahead of Tatum, and 10+ others ahead of Brunson.\nThe Usage Rate is how much a team’s offense runs through an individual player when they are on the court. Giannis at 35.2 is second in the NBA when it comes to Usage Rate, only trailing LaMelo Ball (35.9). SGA has the second highest Usage Rate when it comes to the MVP candidates.\nJokic had a Usage Rate of less than 30, at 29.5 which just puts it into perspective of how elite of a season he had. This means he ranked tied for dead last among the 5 MVP candidates when it came to USG%. He was able to average a triple-double while not even controlling the ball like SGA, Antetokounmpo, Tatum, and Brunson. The Joker is truly one of the most efficient players when it comes to dominating the game in history.\n\n\nCode\nwinshares &lt;- read_csv(\"winshare.csv\")\n\njokic &lt;- winshares |&gt; \n  filter(Player == \"Nikola Jokić\")\n\nshai &lt;- winshares |&gt; \n  filter(Player == \"Shai Gilgeous-Alexander\")\n\ntatum &lt;- winshares |&gt; \n  filter(Player == \"Jayson Tatum\")\n\ngiannis &lt;- winshares |&gt; \n  filter(Player == \"Giannis Antetokounmpo\")\n\nbrunson &lt;- winshares |&gt; \n  filter(Player == \"Jalen Brunson\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(\n    data=winshares, \n    aes(x=WS, y=`USG%`, size=G),\n    alpha = .3) +\n  scale_size(range = c(2, 6), name=\"Games Played\") +\n   geom_point(\n    data=jokic,\n    aes(x=WS, y=`USG%`, size=G),\n    color=\"lightblue\") +\n   geom_point(\n    data=shai,\n    aes(x=WS, y=`USG%`, size=G),\n    color=\"lightblue\") +\n   geom_point(\n    data=tatum,\n    aes(x=WS, y=`USG%`, size=G),\n    color=\"purple\") +\n   geom_point(\n    data=giannis,\n    aes(x=WS, y=`USG%`, size=G),\n    color=\"purple\") +\n   geom_point(\n    data=brunson,\n    aes(x=WS, y=`USG%`, size=G),\n    color=\"purple\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 4.241935, color=\"black\") + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 21.27189, color=\"black\") +\n geom_text(\n    aes(x=13.10, y=25, label=\"High Win Shares, High Usage\"), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(x=2.15, y=9.85, label=\"Low Win Shares, Low Usage\"), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(x=16.63, y=33, label=\"Shai\") \n    ) +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(x=16.33, y=27.7, label=\"Jokic\") \n    ) +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(x=11.5, y=33.58, label=\"Giannis\") \n    ) +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(x=10.85, y=31.25, label=\"Tatum\") \n    ) +\n   geom_text(\n    aes(x=9.93, y=29.5, label=\"Brunson\") \n    ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks=c(8,12,16,20,24,28,32,36)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17)) +\n   labs(\n    x=\"Win Shares\", \n    y=\"Usage Rate\", \n    title=\"The Joker and SGA Far Ahead of the Pack\", \n    subtitle=\"The &lt;span style = 'color:lightblue;'&gt;2 leading candidates&lt;/span&gt; for Most Valuable Player contributed the most to their respective teams' wins \\nin the NBA this year, meanwhile &lt;span style = 'color:purple;'&gt;the other 3&lt;/span&gt; were a little further behind.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Dylan DuPont\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple()\n  ) +\n   theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen looking at most people’s top 5 candidates for MVP, it’s clear that the top 2 most deserving are Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Nikola Jokic, they run away from the rest. Jokic’s insane season of averaging a triple-double again puts him ahead of SGA, although you can’t discredit SGA’s incredible scoring season. Jokic could and should very well be onto his 4th MVP and 2nd consecutive."
